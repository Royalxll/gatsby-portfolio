## About

> What about me, Geez where to start.

An introvert that has a fascination for the ever-growing tech world. Was introduced to coding in high school and was instantly intrigued to this field and always know deep down that this was something I see myself doing and having an interest in. I've always had a love for gaming ever since I was a child that will probably never fade away. Also a wide spread love and appreciation for music of multiple genres. And no nerd is complete without some anime.
